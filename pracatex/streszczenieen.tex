Improving classification with meta-algorithms
\end{center}

\section*{Abstract}
In the thesis are presented meta-algorithms of bagging, boosting and stacking and as well their influences on improving quality of data classification.  The methods were tested with authentic and variuos sets of data.
The thesis comprise methods of rating classifier to obtain reliable results and algorithms
used to balancing classes in sets with big advantage of the predominance of one class. Cooperation of the algorithms with their meta-algorithms were compared and tested. In the thesis an expert classifier and meta-classifier were proposed, which were written and tested on authentic data sets.
